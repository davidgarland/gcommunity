The community repository for GNU KISS Linux.

GKISS Linux community repos will not accept any package builds which function on KISS Linux. These packages should be added to the KISS Linux community repo.

All builds in the community directory should be for free open source software.

Non FOSS builds should be placed in the propietary subdirectory.

Unlike KISS we permit packages such as DBUS to be packaged here, HOWEVER, this is mainly meant to satisfy dependencies for propietary applications. Please exclude dbus from your builds if possible. If you're including it then please reason as to why you're doing so.

Thanks to @periish for creating periish/kiss-dbus who's builds have been moved here.

Thanks to @aosync for creating package builds at-spi2-core as well as atk-bridge needed by discord.
